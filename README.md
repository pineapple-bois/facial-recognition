# Image recognition using PCA

----

### Using the [Olivetti Faces Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html?highlight=olivetti+faces) from `scikit-learn`

----

This dataset contains a set of face images taken between 1992 and 1994 at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge, MA

----

As described on the original website:

There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).
